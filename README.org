* Cached Log-In System

** Project Overview

The Cached Log-In System is a scalable, high-performance authentication system built using Go, Redis, and PostgreSQL, containerized with Docker. The system leverages Redis for caching user session data to improve log-in speed and PostgreSQL for persistent storage of user credentials and profiles.

** Features

- User Authentication: Secure log-in and log-out functionalities.
- Session Management: Efficient session handling using Redis for caching.
- Persistent Storage: User data stored in PostgreSQL.
- Dockerized Deployment: Easy setup and deployment with Docker.

** Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories and files as follows:

- Dockerfile: The Docker configuration file for building the application image.
- docker-compose.yml: The Docker Compose file for setting up the multi-container application.
- README.md: The project documentation (this file).
- main.go: The main application code written in Go.
- config/: Configuration files for the application.
- handlers/: HTTP handlers for different routes.
- models/: Database models for PostgreSQL.
- utils/: Utility functions and helpers.
- scripts/: Any additional scripts for setup or maintenance.
